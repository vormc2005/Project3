## General Info

This application is meant for someone who wants to get rid of old junk for some coin, or for someone who is in need of an every day appliance. Bidbot allows user to post or bid on items in our database. Using React.js, the user is able to place bids on items or post items (without images for now) to be bid on by other users. 

## Instructions

In order to use the application, be sure to install all of the dependencies (see below). If the user would like to test in development, they must run npm start in the command line after running npm run seed to populate the database.

## Functionality

- Landing page where user decides where they would like to go.
